# CS-470 Project Description

This repo contains code from my time in the Full Stack Development II course. This course focused on modern, cloud-based application development. The course covered the deployment of full-stack applications using containerization and serverless architecture. This course heavily utilized Amazon Web Services (AWS), including S3 for storage and Lambda for serverless computing, and I learned to build RESTful APIs using AWS Lambda functions. I also utilised Docker and Docker Compose to containerize applications, manage containerized services, and define application stacks.
